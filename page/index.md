{% newthought 'Autonomous Vehicles and Bicycle Interactions'%}

With the Biden administration underway, legislators have recently made a renewed efforts to officially pass a bill to federally regulate autonomous vehicles (AVs). While AVs are generally lauded for their innovation and potential to revolutionize not only transportation, but also society at large (a belief I too am apt to support), I think itâ€™s worth scrutinizing the necessity of such vehicles. 
Are they really what we need as a society? What controversies from current research (and lack thereof)? 
Bicycle and AV interactions are an excellent case study of this dilemma.
